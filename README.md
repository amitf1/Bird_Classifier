# Birds_Classifier
Classification of Birds species

A NN model using Transfer learning with Mobilenet trained on imagenet, designed to classify 1 out of 200 birds' species for each given image.
The data consists of train, validation and test labeled datasets of bird images

The API is a Flask application which enables a user to upload an image or to use the camera and get the classification for a bird's specie.

Birds_MobileNet.ipynb shows the process of developing and analysing the model and MobileNet_Bird_Classifier.py has a module with fit/predict UI.
